# React + Vite
I started developing this app on Monday and spent a total of around 12 hours on it (Monday: 3h, Tuesday: 3h, Wednesday: 6h).

Challenges I encountered:

Creating a hover effect for select options – I solved this by using a React library.

Responsiveness of filters – I used CSS Grid instead of Flexbox to ensure the filters display well on smaller screens like iPads and smartphones.

Implementing filtering logic – The first two days were mainly spent on the app’s functionality, while the final day was focused on visual polish and UI improvements.

I added a button for sorting in both ascending and descending order.

The installment information is displayed based on the screen width: on desktop, three installments are visible; on iPad, two; and on mobile, one. The cards automatically adjust to fit these different screen sizes.
